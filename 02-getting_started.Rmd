# R Patched and Development Versions {#GetStart}

These instructions cover how to install R from source or from binaries.
Contributors will typically need to work with the patched or development versions of R.
This chapter describes where the source code for these versions can be found and how to install these versions from the source or the binary builds (where available).
The tools required to build R and R packages are also discussed.
For the most up to date and complete instructions you can check the [R installation and administration manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html) .

## The R Source Code

R uses [svn](https://subversion.apache.org/ "SVN official page") as a version control tool hosted at <https://svn.r-project.org/R/> and uses a 'major.minor.patchlevel' version numbering scheme[^02-getting_started-1].

[^02-getting_started-1]: Also known as [semantic versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Semantic_versioning "Wikipedia explanation of semantic versioning")

There are three releases of R available to install:

-   The latest official release (`r-release`), either major version x.0.0 or minor version x.y.0, for example: 3.0.0 or 3.2.0

-   The patched release (`r-patched`), for example 3.0.1 or 3.2.1 and

-   The development release (`r-devel`) : continually developed version moving from r-release to next major/minor version (x + 1).0.0 or x.(y + 1).0 a few weeks before release (at the start of the "GRAND FEATURE FREEZE").

The source code of released versions of R can be found at [R/tags](https://svn.r-project.org/R/tags/ "svn release source code folder"), the patched versions are at [R/branch](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ "svn patched source code folder").


The `r-devel` at [R/trunk](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk "svn devel source code folder") is the next minor or eventual major release development version of R.
Bug fixes and new features are introduced in `r-devel` first. 
If the change meets the [development guidelines](https://developer.r-project.org/devel-guidelines.txt) R Core will also make the change in `r-patched`.

## Prerequisites

To install from the source code you will need the source code and the dependencies of R.

Retrieve R source code via into `TOP_SRCDIR`, note that we retrieve the r-devel source code:

      export TOP_SRCDIR="$HOME/Downloads/R"
      svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ "$TOP_SRCDIR"

If you need to install svn you can use your distribution's package manager to install it.

### Windows

1.  [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is the toolchain bundle that you can use to build R base and R packages containing compiled code, on Windows. 
  The latest [version Rtools42](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/rtools.html) can be installed using the [Rtools installer rtools42-XXXX-XXX.exe ](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/files/).

2.  A LaTeX compilers is needed to install and building R, check packages and build  manuals. 
    The MiKTeX distribution of LaTeX that is used on CRAN can be downloaded from <https://miktex.org>. 
    Once installed open it via the windows start menu.
    It might ask to check for updates and, most importantly, to make it available in the PATH; accept both. 


### macOS


## Building R 

### Linux

Here are the basic steps intended as a checklist.
For complete instructions please see the section in [R-admin](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-admin.html#Installing-R-under-Unix_002dalikes).

1.  Download the latest recommended packages[^02-getting_started-2]:

        $TOP_SRCDIR/tools/rsync-recommended

3.  Create the build directory in the `BUILDDIR`:

        export BUILDDIR="$HOME/bin/R"
        mkdir -p "$BUILDDIR"
        cd "$BUILDDIR"
        
4.  Configure the R installation (with `--enable-R-shlib` so that RStudio IDE can use it):
        
        "$TOP_SRCDIR/configure" --enable-R-shlib
        
4.  Build R :

        make 


5.  Check that R works as expected:

        make check

    There are other checks you can run:

        make check-devel
        make check-recommended


[^02-getting_started-2]: Recommended packages are not in the subversion repository.


If we don't want to build R in a different directory than the source code we can simply use:

    cd "$TOP_SRCDIR"
    svn update
    tools/rsync-recommended
    "$TOP_SRCDIR/configure"  --enable-R-shlib
    make 
    make check

Once you successfully build R from source you can modify R source code to fix an issue: Prepare a patch (See [this guide](https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html#how-to-submit-patches)) and after checking that R works as intended (`make check-devel`) submit the patch for the R core consideration.
(See the [lifecycle of a patch](#FixBug) chapter).


To use the r-devel version in RStudio to you can do the following:

    export RSTUIDO_WHICH_R="$BUILDDIR/bin/R"
    cd "$TOP_SRCDIR"
    rstudio


### Windows

#### Binaries

We can follow the [latest documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/howto-R-4.2.html) about installing R and packages from source:

1.  The binary builds of R for Windows can be downloaded and installed from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/).
    Along with the link to the latest stable release, this page also contains links to the binary builds of `r-patched` and `r-devel`.

2.  Click on the download links to download an executable installer.

3.  Select the language while installing, read the GNU general public license information, and select the destination location to start the installation.
    You will be prompted to select components at this stage: `User installation`, `64-bit User installation`, or `Custom installation`.
    The default option may be chosen for the questions from this step onwards to complete the installation.
    
Daily binaries for `r-devel` are made available for [download and installation](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rdevel.html). 

#### From source

You can download the R sources on Windows <https://svn.r-project.org/R/>. 
But if you want to keep up with changes it is recommended to checkout the sources from svn, it is probably best to install an SVN client.
Either TortoiseSVN (<https://tortoisesvn.net/>, command line tool, and Windows Explorer integration) or SlikSVN (<https://sliksvn.com/download/>, just the command line tool) is recommended.

1.  Open the Rtools42 terminal, and update and get the tools:

      pacman -Syuu
      pacman -Sy wget subversion
      
2. Download the latest tcl/tk and unzip it in `$TOP_SRCDIR`:

      cd "$TOP_SRCDIR"
      wget -np -nd -r -l1 -A 'tcltk-*.zip' https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools42/files/
      unzip "tcltk-*.zip"
      
3. Set environment variables for gcc, POSIX, MiKTeX, tar and one tar option:

        export PATH=/x86_64-w64-mingw32.static.posix/bin:$PATH
        export PATH=/c/Program\ Files/MiKTeX/miktex/bin/x64:$PATH
        export TAR="/usr/bin/tar"
        export TAR_OPTIONS="--force-local"

4. Check that all the programs can be found:

        which make gcc pdflatex tar
        
    If there is any error you'll need to find where the program is installed and add the corresponding path.
    
1.  Download the latest recommended packages[^02-getting_started-2]:

         cd "$TOP_SRCDIR/src/gnuwin32/"
        "$TOP_SRCDIR/tools/rsync-recommended"
        
    This is equivalent of using `make rsync-recommended`.

3.  Build R and the recommended files:
       
        make all recommended
        
    The recently compiled version of R will be at `$TOP_SRCDIR/bin/`.
    In RStudio you can select that folder and restart it to use the r-devel version.

5.  Check that R works as expected:

        make check

    There are other checks you can run:

        make check-devel
        make check-recommended
