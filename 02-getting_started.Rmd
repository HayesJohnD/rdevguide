# Getting Started 

These instructions cover how to install $\textsf{R}$ in Windows. The tools required to build $\textsf{R}$ and $\textsf{R}$ packages in Windows are also discussed.

## Installing $\textsf{R}$

To install $\textsf{R}$ in Windows follow these steps:

1. Go to https://cran.r-project.org.

2. Select `Download R for Windows`. You will be directed to a page which shows `Subdirectories` for installing R on Windows.

3. Select `base` subdirectory. Alternatively, you can select `install R for the first time`, it leads to the same page. The current official stable release distribution of $\textsf{R}$ can be downloaded from here. (Along with the link to the current official stable release, links to the development snapshot build and to the previous releases, are also available on this page).

4. This distribution is distributed as an installer `R-x.y.z-win.exe`. The `x.y.z` in the $\textsf{R}$ system version represent the major, minor, and patchlevel numbers, respectively.

5. This has to be run in the Windows-style installer.

6. Select the language while installing, read the public license information, and select destination location to the start the installation. You will be prompted to select components at this stage: `User installation`, `32-bit User installation`, `64-bit User installation`, or `Custom installation`. The default option may be opted for the questions from this step onwards. 

7. Complete the installation.

## General instructions

1. If you install the latest version or R-patched or R-devel, it will not over-write the previous installation(s) in your Windows machine.

2. Daily [tarballs](https://stat.ethz.ch/R/daily/) are available for the patched version of the current release (`r-patched`), and the development version of the current release (`r-devel`). The same are also available via the [R Subversion repository](https://svn.R-project.org/R/)

## Building $\textsf{R}$ and $\textsf{R}$ packages

### What tools you need to build $\textsf{R}$ from source on Windows?

1. `RTools` is the [subdirectory](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) which you want to build $\textsf{R}$ or your own $\textsf{R}$ package(s) on Windows. 

2. You also need a distribution of $\LaTeX$ installed for building $\textsf{R}$ and checking packages. The `MiKTeX` distribution of $\LaTeX$ that is used on CRAN can be downloaded from https://miktex.org.

### How to setup `RTools`?

1. The latest version of `RTools` can be downloaded from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ and run in the Windows-style installer. You will need to know if you have a 32-bit or 64-bit Windows machine (right-click `This PC` in Windows Explorer and check the properties if you are unsure).

2. Don't forget to add `RTools` to the path as documented on the download page.

### How to build $\textsf{R}$?

To build $\textsf{R}$ for Windows using `RTools` follow the instructions in this [readme](https://github.com/r-windows/r-base#readme) file.
