## Installing R

To install R in Windows follow these steps:

1. Go to https://cran.r-project.org.

2. Select `Download R for Windows`. You will be directed to a page which shows `Subdirectories` for installing R on Windows.

3. Select `base` subdirectory. (Alternatively, you can select `install R for the first time`, it leads to the same page). The recent stable release distribution of R can be downloaded from here. 

4. The distribution is distributed as an installer ($\ge$) `R-4.0.4-win.exe`.

5. This has to be run in the Windows-style installer.

6. Select the language while installing, read the public license information, and select destination location to the start the installation. You will be prompted to select components at this stage: `User installation`, `32-bit User installation`, `64-bit User installation`, or `Custom installation`. The default option may be opted for the questions from this step onwards. 

7. Complete the installation.

## General instructions

1. The R executable downloaded by following the above steps, is the binary distribution of ($\ge$) `R-4.0.4`, which can run on Windows XP and above versions (including 64-bit versions of Windows). It can run on ix86 and x86_64 chips.

2. There are two versions of the R executable, the 32-bit version (in `R-4.0.4\bin\i386`) and the 64-bit version (in `R-4.0.4\bin\x64`). On the 32-bit versions of Windows, by default only the former gets installed, whereas on the 64-bit versions, both get installed. 

3. If there is already a previous version of R installed in your system and you want to retain the packages installed in it, then: 
  a) Uninstall R (write here, how to uninstall R)
