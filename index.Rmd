# Acknowledgement

Initial chapters of this guide were developed by Saranjeet Kaur Bhogal, in a project funded by the R Foundation, mentored by Heather Turner and Michael Lawrence. It draws on documentation and articles written by the R Core Team. The initial version of the guide was upgraded as a part of the [Google Season of Docs 2022](https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/wiki/GSOD-2022-Proposal) project with two Technical Writers and reviewed by the [Steering Committee](https://github.com/rstats-gsod/gsod2022/wiki/GSOD-2022-Proposal#steering-committee).

This guide has benefited and continues to be benefited from varied contributions by several [contributors](https://github.com/r-devel/rdevguide#contributors-).
