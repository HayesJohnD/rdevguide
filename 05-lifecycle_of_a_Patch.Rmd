# Lifecycle of a Patch {#FixBug}

## Introduction

R uses a workflow based on patches. What this means is that you can create a patch and submit it through your official Bugzilla account to the core developer(s) and/ or package maintainer(s).

## When do you submit a patch?

There might be a situation where you come across a bug in R, which you may have an idea of how to fix. This can turn out to be an opportunity for you to submit a patch. By submitting a patch or a bug fix, you are helping to reduce the workload on the R developers in addition to yourself being a contributor to R!  

When you submit a patch, you are helping the developer(s) and maintainer(s) so that they do not have to write the entire code from scratch. Instead, they can test and tweak your patch, if necessary.

## What tools are required to submit a patch?

To submit a patch, you need:

1. [SVN](http://subversion.apache.org/) installed on your machine.

2. The latest developer version of R.

## How to submit a patch?

Refer to the guidelines given [here](https://www.r-project.org/bugs.html#how-to-submit-patches) for the process to submit a patch in R.

## Reviewing patches

If a bug report or an issue has a patch attached that has not been reviewed, you can help by making sure that the patch:

1. Follows the style guides.

2. Is a good solution to the problem it is trying to solve.

3. Includes proper tests.

4. Includes proper documentation changes.

Doing all of this allows the core developer(s) and/ or maintainer(s) to more quickly look for subtle issues that only people with extensive experience working on R's codebase will notice.

## share examples of patch reports on Bugzilla+?

## share examples where people have acted as reviewers for patches

**Note**:

There is a `#patches-for-review` channel on the [R-devel slack](https://r-devel.slack.com/) where you can share your patch(es) for review/feedback before submitting to R-Core/Bugzilla. This can help with checking that you have included the important information and excluded redundant information.
