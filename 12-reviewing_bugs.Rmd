# Reviewing Bugs

## How you can help to review bug reports?

Once you are aware where bugs are reported in $\textsf{R}$, a great way to contribute is to help reviewing the bug reports.

Around the clock, new bug reports are being submitted on Bugzilla or the bug trackers (for instance, GitHub issues) of $\textsf{R}$ packages and existing bug reports are being updated. Every bug report needs to be reviewed to make sure various things are in proper order. You can help with this process of reviewing bugs. 

Note: If you want to review bug reports on Bugzilla, you are required to have a Bugzilla account. To get a Bugzilla account send an e-mail to `bug-report-request@r-project.org` from the address you want to use as your login. Briefly explain why you want a Bugzilla account and a volunteer will add you to $\textsf{R}$'s Bugzilla members.

### Classifying bug reports

A good bug report is the one which:

1. Clearly explains the bug so that it can be reproduced.

2. Includes the version of $\textsf{R}$, the machine architecture, and the operating system platform on which the bug occurred.

These are the relevant details that should be a part of a good bug report. You can help with these things once you have experience developing for $\textsf{R}$:

1. Reproducing the bug: If you see a bug report which does not clearly explains how to reproduce it, you can try reproducing the bug and eventually make things easier for the core developer(s) and/or package maintainer(s).

2. Check whether the bug occurs on a different version of $\textsf{R}$. It is helpful to know if a bug is not only affecting the
