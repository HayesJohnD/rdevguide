This is more in-depth review, but could borrow some ideas: match people with similar interests don’t go back to same person too often create community of on-rampers sharing error messages from CRAN to create more user-friendly checklists, pointers to relevant parts of docs Zulip chat as alternative to R-package-devel to provide ad-hoc help Step-by-step guide for people to review their own package before submission? use some of tools from rOpensci? Chatbot like rOpenSci one helping with package review, to help submitters? "]
