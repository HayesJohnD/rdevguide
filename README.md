This guide is a work in progress, inspired by http://devguide.python.org/. It is currently deployed at https://forwards.github.io/rdevguide/.

## Background Resources

A list of existing resources on R core development that we can use for reference or that we should document in the guide is given in the [Wiki for this repo](https://github.com/forwards/rdevguide/wiki).

## Contributing

### Without write access

Corrections, suggestions and general improvements are welcome as [issue submissions](https://github.com/forwards/rdevguide/issues/new).

You can also suggest changes by editing the .Rmd files that are at the root of this repository and submitting a pull request. Please target your pull requests to the `master` branch.

### With write access

You can push directly to `master` for small fixes. Please use PRs to `master` for discussing larger updates - try to limit to one section or at least one chapter in each PR, so that changes are easier to review.

## Technical details

Deployment is done via Travis CI:

- whenever there's a push to master, the book is built and its content is put in the `docs` directory.

If you want to render the guide locally, you need to install `bookdown`. Then use 

```bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook')```

and the book will be generated in the `docs` folder. You can open the guide on the command line via `open docs/index.html`.
